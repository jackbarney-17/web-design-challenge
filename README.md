# web-design-challenge

### This repository is for a Web Design homework assignment in which students were to create a website detailing analysis previously completed for a separate assignment.

### The website is a dashboard that looks at possible relationships or correlations that may occur between a given city's latitude and weather patterns such as maximum temperature, humidity, percentage of cloudiness, and average wind speed experienced on a given datae.

### The data displayed on the website originally came from scraping an OpenWeather API to create a dataset of 500 random cities from around the world and each of the city's corresponding weather data. The data was cleaned up, processed, and visualized using Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries.
